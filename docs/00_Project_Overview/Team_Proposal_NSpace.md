# Team Proposal: NSpace \- European Rover Challenge

1. ## **Introduction**

NSpace is a newly formed, multidisciplinary team of highly motivated students from the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia. Our members bring diverse expertise spanning Computing and Control Engineering, Computer Science, Mechatronics, Biomedical Engineering, Graphic Design, and modeling. A shared passion unites us for robotics, automation, AI, and tackling complex engineering challenges. What draws us to science is its boundless nature and the freedom it offers for creative thinking. In the future, we see ourselves as future teaching assistants and professors. However, we believe that to truly earn those roles, we must first go through a wide range of experiences and challenges. Academic excellence cannot be built on theoretical knowledge alone.

Throughout our studies, countless hours of learning and problem-solving have shaped us and brought us to a point where we are confident—it’s time to take our first big steps into the world of science. We are eager to apply our collective knowledge and collaborative spirit to the European Rover Challenge.

3. ## **Team Composition and Organization**

While formal roles are still evolving, our initial structure leverages members' primary areas of expertise:

* **Team Lead/Coordination:** Djordje M.  
* **Control Systems & Simulation:** Djordje M., Dusan G., Jovana N., Konstantin M., Mihajlo I., Nemanja S.  
* **Software Development (AI/ML Focus):** Marko M., Mihailo V., Milos O., Nemanja S.  
* **Embedded Systems & Hardware:** Dusan G., Jovana N., Konstantin M., Mihajlo I., Nemanja S.  
* **Software Development (Web/App Focus):** Mihailo V., Milos O.  
* **Communication & Networking:** Dusan G., Milos O., Marko M.  
* **Design & Documentation:** Jovana N., Tijana F.  
* **Marketing & Public Relations:** Djordje M., Tijana F.

We plan to adopt an agile methodology, utilizing regular meetings (both virtual and in-person), shared code repositories (Git/GitHub), and collaborative project management tools to ensure effective communication and progress tracking. Responsibilities will be assigned based on task requirements and individual strengths, encouraging cross-functional collaboration.

4. ## **Team Plan**

Our high-level plan focuses on leveraging our diverse skill set to address the core challenges of the ERC:

**From Qualification results to Connectivity test:**

Until the connectivity test, our members who possess ROS skills will share their knowledge with the rest of the team. We will also thoroughly read the documentation related to the Husarion robot and how we can program it. Besides the robot documentation, we will go through the documentation for using the HusarionNet VPN and Discovery server, as well as account creation and management. On social media, we will occasionally publish posts introducing the team, along with some posts and reels featuring educational/historical/entertaining content. In the meantime, we will begin developing our prototype rover, aiming for it to resemble the competition rover's characteristics as closely as possible. We also plan to create a prototype Marsyard environment. Using files from GitHub, we will set up our simulation environment for the rover. In addition to all this, we will be active on the forum and keen to help other members during the competition if they encounter problems in any area.

We also plan to create a website for our team.

Regarding new members, we will be looking for colleagues who are experts in mechanical engineering for suggestions on potential mechanical limitations we might face in certain situations, and for the analysis of mechanical parts we will use in developing our rover.

We will expand our team with colleagues who wish to connect the entire project with sponsors and academic partners to promote science through traditional and digital media. The goal is to build a community and familiarize the general public with the function and significance of the rover\!

**From Connectivity test to Payload test:**

We are preparing for the payload test. We will hold brainstorming sessions to consider ways to control the rover during the test itself, meaning we will devise a detailed plan as outlined in the handbook and aim to fulfill it to the greatest extent possible. Our goal will be to explore the terrain extensively and collect as much data as possible for later processing. Initially, we will map the course manually without any autonomy. Only when we have all the available data will we develop autonomous control. We believe that quality control (especially autonomous) cannot be established without sufficient data about the entire system and its environment.

At that point, we will be able to divide the team into several smaller sub-teams, each dealing with independent parts. Meanwhile, our rover and test environment should be ready, allowing us to start collecting and processing smaller datasets. The hierarchy would be as follows: First, create a digital model of the robot and terrain, then simulate it, parameterize it according to our robot and terrain dimensions, and finally, compare the simulation data with the data we have collected.

**From Payload test to Challenge test:**

Further refinement of terrain mapping, information gathering, autonomous operation mode, improvement and optimization of algorithms, and other segments according to additional information and documentation that will be published by the organizers. Concurrently, we will strive to be more active on social media, posting our team's progress creatively and engagingly.

**From Challenge Test to Finals:**

Besides focusing on further refining all aspects related to the competition, we plan, given the remote nature of the competition, to organize an event in our city (Novi Sad, Vojvodina-Serbia) to inform our fellow citizens about our success and achievements. Within this event, we would also further promote the competition and encourage young people to engage in science, think about space, and push the boundaries of human achievement.

6. ## **Wildcard**

With Professor Zoran Jeličić’s mentorship, we’ll leverage his network to connect with additional professors from the FTN Department of Automation and Control Systems. This collaboration will provide expert guidance on control algorithms, embedded systems, and optimization, enhancing our solutions for Challenges 1 and 2\. By July, we’ll compile a ‘Mentorship Insights’ guide—key lessons from this expertise—and share it on the Forum, earning technical points and supporting community learning.
